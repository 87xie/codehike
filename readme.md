Code Hike is an open-source toolset for building all types of **code walkthroughs**: blog posts, tutorials, quickstarts, slides, videos, workshops, docs, and so on.

> **February 2021 status:** [Experimental versions on NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/org/code-hike). Still unstable, undocumented, and buggy. Codesandbox examples coming soon. Work is happening on the [v0.3 branch](https://github.com/code-hike/codehike/tree/v0.3). Currently working on a [new high-level package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@code-hike/scrollycoding).
