**There isn't a stable version yet**, but there's a preview version for people who want to try it out and [give feedback](https://github.com/code-hike/codehike/discussions). You can use it in any project that has MDX v2 configured. Or you can clone [this starter project](https://github.com/pomber/code-hike-sample).
