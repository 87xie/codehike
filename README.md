Code Hike is an open-source toolset for building all types of **code walkthroughs**: blog posts, tutorials, quickstarts, slides, videos, workshops, docs, and so on.

> **August 2020 status:** [Experimental versions on NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/org/code-hike). Still very unstable, very undocumented, very buggy, and not very fast. Codesandbox examples coming soon for early adopters.


Currently working on prototypes and refining the APIs and package's boundaries. No packages published to npm yet. [May publish an experimental version before August](https://twitter.com/codehike_/status/1283780762882519040).
